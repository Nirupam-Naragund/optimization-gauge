##  Optimization Gauge for Web Apps

The Optimization Gauge for Web Apps is a powerful tool designed to help developers identify and analyze performance bottlenecks in web applications. By examining factors such as network latency, rendering times, and JavaScript execution speed, this package provides valuable insights into the performance characteristics of web applications, enabling developers to optimize their code and deliver better user experiences.

## Install

```sh
npm install optimization-gauge
```

## Don't forget to set type to module in your package.json 


```sh
["type":"module"](package.json)
```


## Usage

Once installed, you can use the profile function provided by the package to profile the performance of a web application. Here's a basic example of how to use it:

```js
// test.js
import  profile  from 'optimization-gauge';

const runProfiler = async () => {
  const url = 'https://example.com';
  const performanceMetrics = await profile(url);
  console.log(performanceMetrics);
};

runProfiler();

```

```js
node test.js
```

The profile function takes a URL as input and returns a promise that resolves to an object containing various performance metrics such as network latency, rendering time, and JavaScript execution time.

## Why It's Useful

The Optimization Gauge for Web Apps offers several benefits for developers:

1)Identifying Performance Bottlenecks: Developers can use the profiler to pinpoint performance bottlenecks in their web applications, allowing them to optimize critical areas of code and improve overall performance.

2)Optimizing User Experience: By analyzing factors such as network latency and rendering times, developers can optimize their applications to deliver faster load times and smoother user experiences.

3)Debugging Performance Issues: The profiler helps developers diagnose and troubleshoot performance issues, making it easier to identify the root cause of slowdowns and inefficiencies in code.

4)Continuous Improvement: By regularly profiling their web applications, developers can track performance trends over time and make incremental improvements to optimize performance continuously.
